# Operators in C++

## Experiment 3

### AIM
To use operators to add two numbers.

### Theory
Arithmetic operators are symbols used in programming to perform operations on variables and values. They are important for writing expressions and making decisions in code.

#### Types
- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.  
  Example: `a + b`

- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.  
  Example: `a - b`

- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.  
  Example: `a * b`

- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the numerator by the denominator.  
  Example: `a / b`

- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.  
  Example: `a % b`

### Algorithm

1. **Start**

2. **Declare Variables**
   - Declare three integer variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`.

3. **Prompt and Read First Number**
   - Output: `"Enter num 1: "`
   - Read the input value and store it in variable `a`.

4. **Prompt and Read Second Number**
   - Output: `"Enter num 2: "`
   - Read the input value and store it in variable `b`.

5. **Calculate the Sum**
   - Compute the sum of `a` and `b` and store the result in variable `c`.

6. **Output the Result**
   - Output the result: `"The No. is: "` followed by the value of `c`.

7. **End**
